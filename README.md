## Install

Melvor Idle has a way to install mods automatically through the Melvor Mod Manager. The mod should be found there, and will be updated automatically once released to mod.io

To make an update, simply make a zip of all the files you want, including the manifest.json. More information is found at the [wiki page](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/w/Mod_Creation).
